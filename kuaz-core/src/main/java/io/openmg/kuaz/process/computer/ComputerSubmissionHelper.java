     * This is intended to serve as an alternative to {@link ForkJoinPool#commonPool()},
     * which is used by {@link CompletableFuture#supplyAsync(Supplier)} (among other methods).
     * The the single threaded executor created by this method contains a thread
     * with the same context classloader and thread group as the thread that called
     * this method.  Threads created in this method also have predictable behavior when
     * {@link Thread#setContextClassLoader(ClassLoader)} is invoked; threads in the
     * common pool throw a SecurityException if the JVM has a security manager configured.
     * <p>
     * The name of the thread created by this method's internal executor is the concatenation of
     * <ul>
     *     <li>the name of the thread that calls this method</li>
